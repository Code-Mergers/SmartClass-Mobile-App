## Web-To-Android-App-Template 
## TODOS ->
### 1) ADD REFRESH ON SWIPE 
### 2) ADD FULL SCREEN MODE FOR VIDEO PLAYING
### 3) ADD FILE UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD OPTIONS
### 4) ADD PROGRESS-BAR AND CUSTOM PROGRESS NOTIFICATIONS

## PROBLEMS REMAINING ->
### 1) WHEN OFFLINE SUDDENLY, RELOAD BUTTON(IN THE ACTION BAR OF MAIN ACTIVITY) NOT ROUTED TO OFFLINE ACTIVITY SO APP WILL HANG IF THIS BUTTON IS CLICKED HERE IN OFFLINE STATE
### 2) Family label in offline_activity action bar(removed now) was probably due to family label in the android manifest.
